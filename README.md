# Dormant Accounts Compliance Process

## Bank Compliance Actions
Once an account is classified as dormant, the bank follows several regulatory steps:
- Attempts to contact the dormant customer through *written, electronic, or verbal communication*.
- If no response is received within *three months, the funds are transferred to a **dormant accounts ledger* internally.
- *Issuers of unclaimed cheques, bank drafts, or cashier orders* are notified.
- A *final notice* is sent to tenants of dormant *safe deposit boxes* before proceeding with further actions.

## Central Bank Involvement
- If an account remains *dormant for five years, the bank must transfer the funds to the **Central Bank of the UAE* under the Unclaimed Balances Account - Dormant Accounts.
- Unclaimed *safe deposit box charges* are similarly processed through the Central Bank after *five years*.

## Customer Claim & Compliance Checks
- Customers can *reclaim their funds* by visiting their bank and providing necessary identity verification documents.
- Banks *monitor reactivated accounts* closely to *prevent money laundering or fraudulent activities*.
- The *Bank's Compliance Division* and external auditors oversee adherence to regulations.
- The *Central Bank acts as the final repository* for dormant funds and ensures regulatory compliance.
